                        <p>Roberto's Taco Shop is a chain of Mexican restaurants in 
California and Nevada, with locations primarily in San Diego 
and the Las Vegas Valley. It is based in Las Vegas,[1] 
and it had 77 locations as of <time datetime="2022">2020</time>. The company originated with 
a tortilleria that was founded in San Ysidro, San Diego in <time datetime="1964">1964</time>, 
by Roberto Robledo and his wife Dolores. They subsequently purchased
 several restaurants, before renaming them <strong>Roberto's Taco Shop</strong> around 
 1970. The chain expanded to the Las Vegas Valley in 1990, and was
 also operating in Miami by the end of the decade.</p>
